# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Token Efficiency (MANDATORY)
- Responses: shortest possible. No preamble, no recap, no summary.
- Code: no comments unless the WHY is non-obvious. No docstrings.
- No "I'll now...", "Let me...", "Great!" or similar filler.
- Tool calls: batch all independent calls in one message.
- Skip explaining what you just did — the diff speaks.
- One sentence max per status update while working.

## Coding Standards
- No dead code, no unused imports, no backwards-compat shims.
- No defensive error handling for impossible cases.
- No abstractions beyond what the task requires.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- No markdown docs unless explicitly requested.

## Stack
- **Backend** (`backend/`): FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 async + asyncpg, Python 3.12, Alembic, Redis Streams, pgvector, APScheduler. Package: `jarvis-backend` (hatchling), code in `app/`.
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`): Next.js 14 App Router, NextAuth.js, React Query, Tailwind, Radix UI.
- **Infra**: docker-compose orchestrates Postgres 16 (with pgvector), Redis 7, Nginx, n8n, backend, frontend.

## Common Commands

Full stack:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Backend (from `backend/`):
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
pytest --cov=app -v              # coverage must be ≥80% (enforced in pyproject.toml)
pytest tests/test_agents.py::test_executive_delegates_to_research_and_composes  # single test
ruff check app                   # line-length 100, py312
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "msg"
```

Frontend (from `frontend/`):
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build                    # must produce zero TS errors
npm run type-check
npm run lint
```

## Architecture

### Backend layout (`backend/app/`)
- `main.py` — FastAPI app, lifespan starts APScheduler for memory consolidation.
- `config.py`, `database.py` — settings (pydantic-settings) + `AsyncSessionLocal`.
- `api/` — route modules (chat, documents, knowledge, tasks, etc.). Routes call agents/services; they do NOT call AI providers directly.
- `agents/` — agent framework. `registry.py` is a singleton; each agent module registers itself at import time (ADR-007). `orchestrator.py` classifies intent, dispatches by name, supports cross-agent delegation guarded at depth ≤ 3. Agents: `executive`, `research` (Serper), `knowledge` (RAG), `productivity`.
- `router/` — `ModelRouter` selects AI provider/model per task type with exponential backoff failover. Default Gemini 1.5 Flash; financial analysis uses Pro (never Flash). See routing table in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- `memory/` — episodic + semantic memory; `consolidation.py` is the APScheduler nightly job (Postgres job store) that summarizes old episodes into semantic facts and prunes expired records.
- `knowledge/` — document ingestion pipeline: `ingestion.py` (PDF/DOCX/XLSX/CSV/TXT/MD parsers, in-process per ADR-005) → `chunker.py` (512 tokens, 50 overlap, paragraph/sentence boundary preference per ADR-006) → `embedder.py` (batched ≤100 chunks) → `retriever.py` (top-10 + re-rank → top-5) → stored in pgvector.
- `finance/` — Phase 3 scaffolding. Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC) symmetric encryption on amount fields (ADR-009); key from `FINANCIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var. `@with_disclaimer` decorator on Financial Agent appends the regulatory disclaimer (ADR-011).
- `tasks/` — background work consumed via Redis Streams (ADR-002).
- `auth/` — NextAuth-issued JWT validated server-side; TOTP (`pyotp`) for Level 4 actions.

### Tenancy & repository pattern
Application-level tenancy (ADR-001): every domain table has `user_id FK`. A `BaseRepository` enforces `WHERE user_id = :current_user_id` — do not bypass it. No PostgreSQL RLS.

### Frontend layout (`frontend/src/`)
- `app/` — Next.js App Router pages and route handlers (auth, chat, knowledge, tasks).
- `components/` — UI primitives (Radix + Tailwind) and feature components like `KnowledgeClient`, the Assistant view (renders agent name, delegation chain, source citations).
- `lib/` — API client (axios), React Query setup, NextAuth helpers.
- API base resolved via env; the backend is reached through Nginx in prod, direct in dev.

### Chat request flow
`POST /api/v1/chat` → NextAuth session validation → memory retrieval (embed query, pgvector cosine search top-10, re-rank by recency+relevance, inject top-5) → `Orchestrator.dispatch` (intent classification + agent registry lookup, optional delegation) → `ModelRouter.select_model` → AI provider call (logs model, tokens, latency, cost) → async memory write → response. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full diagram.

### Security levels
1 read-only, 2 drafts, 3 execute-with-log (audit_log is append-only — no DELETE), 4 autonomous (requires TOTP + explicit per-session opt-in).

### Phase status
Phase 1 (Foundation) and Phase 2 (Agents + Knowledge Base) are complete. Phase 3 (Financial Intelligence) is the current scope. Current phase details and exit criteria live in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`. ADRs (1–12) are in `ARCHITECTURE.md` — consult them before deviating from existing patterns.

### Regulatory
- Every AI-generated financial response must carry the "not a licensed financial advisor" disclaimer (decorator + frontend `<FinanceDisclaimer />`). A test asserts 100% disclaimer coverage on financial AI outputs.
- All user data deletable via `DELETE /api/v1/user/me`, exportable via `GET /api/v1/user/export`. `privacy_mode` blocks sending PII to AI providers.
